# Loneliness and Deprivation in England

This repository contains supplementary material for our coursework submission for the Advanced Data Science course (COMSM0056 2020/21).

## Code

Code for generating the models and visualisations can be found in the Jupyter notebooks in this repo.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Laura Gemmell for being an awesome supervisor and the lecturers and our cohort's TA, Emily Vosper, on the Advanced Data Science course for teaching us so much. We shamelessly stole the colour scheme for the bivariate choropleth from [Joshua Stevens](https://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/).
